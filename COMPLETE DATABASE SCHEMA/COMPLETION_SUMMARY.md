# - docker-compose.yml (UPDATED - complete orchestration)
# - IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (NEW - step-by-step guide)
# - .env.example (UPDATED - all config)
```

### **STEP 3: Follow Implementation Guide**
Open `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` and follow these sections:

3. **File Upload System** (20 min) - Implement file uploads
4. **AI Tutor Integration** (45 min) - Add real Claude API
5. **Assessment Auto-Grading** (30 min) - Implement grading logic

**Total time**: 2-3 hours for all HIGH PRIORITY items

### **STEP 4: Start Services**
```bash
# Start infrastructure
docker-compose up -d db redis minio opensearch

# Initialize database
docker exec -i eureka-db psql -U eureka -d eureka < ops/db/init_complete.sql

# Start backend services
docker-compose up -d api-core tutor-llm assess adaptive analytics

# Start frontend
cd apps/web && npm run dev
```

### **STEP 5: Test**

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -d '{"email":"admin@demo.edu","password":"Admin123!"}'

# Ask AI Tutor
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/tutor/ask \
  -d '{"message":"What is photosynthesis?"}'

# Test auto-grading
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/v1/assess/grade \
