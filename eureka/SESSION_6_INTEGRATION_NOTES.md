# Session 6 Part I Integration Notes

## Integration Status: ⚠️ Partial

Session 6 Part I has been integrated but the services are not yet functional due to missing components and configuration issues.

## What Was Integrated ✅

### Files Added:
- **Tutor-LLM Service**: `services/tutor-llm/` (8 files)
- **Assessment Engine**: `services/assessment-engine/` (6 files)
- **System Status Updates**: Updated port mappings to 8050-8051

### Services Configuration:
- AI Tutor (LLM): Port 8050
- Assessment Engine: Port 8051

## Issues Preventing Services from Starting ❌

### 1. Database Authentication
**Service**: Tutor-LLM
**Error**: `password authentication failed for user "eureka"`

**Expected Database Config**:
```
User: eureka
Password: eureka123
Database: eureka
Host: localhost:5432
```

**Current Status**: PostgreSQL is running (`biomedical-postgres` container on port 5432) but may have different credentials.

**Solution Needed**:
- Either update the service config to match your existing database
- Or create a new `eureka` database with the expected credentials

### 2. Missing API Module
**Service**: Assessment Engine
**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.api'`

**Current Structure**:
```
assessment-engine/app/
├── core/       ✅ Present
├── schemas/    ✅ Present
├── services/   ✅ Present
└── api/        ❌ MISSING
```

**Solution Needed**:
- Session 6 Part 1 appears incomplete
- API endpoint implementations are missing
- May need Session 6 Part 2 or a complete archive

## Workaround

The services are integrated into the codebase but won't start until:

1. **Database Setup**: Create EUREKA database with correct credentials
2. **Complete Code**: Obtain missing API endpoint files
3. **Dependencies**: All Python packages are installed

## Current Service Status

Visit: http://localhost:4500/system-status

Both services will show as **offline** (red) until the above issues are resolved.

## Recommendations

1. **Check for Session 6 Part 2**: The archive may contain the remaining files
2. **Database Setup**: Run database migrations to create the EUREKA schema
3. **Alternative**: Wait for complete Session 6 release with all components

## What Works ✅

- ✅ Services code is integrated into project structure
- ✅ Port assignments updated (no conflicts)
- ✅ System status page tracks the new services
- ✅ Python dependencies can be installed
- ✅ Configuration files are in place

## What Doesn't Work ❌

- ❌ Services cannot start (database + missing modules)
- ❌ API endpoints not accessible
- ❌ Health checks fail (connection refused)
- ❌ No database tables created

**Integration Date**: October 28, 2025
**Session 6 Progress**: Code integrated, services not operational
**Next Steps**: Obtain complete Session 6 code or resolve database/API issues
