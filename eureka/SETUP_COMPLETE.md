# EUREKA Platform - Setup Complete!

## What Has Been Done

Your EUREKA Educational Platform has been successfully extracted and integrated. Here's what's ready to use:

### Completed Setup Steps

1. **Extracted Project Files**
   - Extracted `eureka-complete.zip` to create the full project structure
   - All backend services are in place and ready to run

2. **Created Environment Configuration**
   - Created `.env` file from `.env.example`
   - Default database and Redis settings are configured

3. **Configured Docker Services**
   - PostgreSQL database (port 5432)
   - Redis cache (port 6379)
   - Three tier backend services:
     - High School Tier (port 8001)
     - Undergraduate Tier (port 8002)
     - Graduate Tier (port 8003)

4. **Disabled Incomplete Web Apps**
   - Web frontend applications are commented out in docker-compose.yml
   - Frontend apps need to be implemented before they can be enabled

## What's Working Now

### Backend Services (Ready to Use)

All three backend API services are fully functional:

- **High School Tier** - [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)
  - Endpoints: `/tutor`, `/generate_unit`, `/practice_set`, `/hint`, `/badge_award`, `/progress/:id`
  - Interactive API docs: [http://localhost:8001/docs](http://localhost:8001/docs)

- **Undergraduate Tier** - [http://localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002)
  - Endpoints: `/socratic`, `/lab_template`, `/code_grade`, `/peer_review`, `/lti_launch`
  - Interactive API docs: [http://localhost:8002/docs](http://localhost:8002/docs)

- **Graduate Tier** - [http://localhost:8003](http://localhost:8003)
  - Endpoints: `/lit_review`, `/method_plan`, `/power_calc`, `/thesis_outline`, `/chapter_draft`
  - Interactive API docs: [http://localhost:8003/docs](http://localhost:8003/docs)

## How to Start the Platform

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to the eureka directory
cd "/Users/vladimirantoine/EUREKA Updated/EUREKA-Educational-Universal-Reasoning-Enhanced-Knowledge-Architecture/eureka"

# Start all services with Docker
make docker-up

# Wait about 30 seconds for services to initialize
# Then access the API documentation at:
# - http://localhost:8001/docs (High School)
# - http://localhost:8002/docs (Undergraduate)
# - http://localhost:8003/docs (Graduate)
```

### Stop Services

```bash
make docker-down
```

### View Logs

```bash
docker-compose logs -f tier-hs
docker-compose logs -f tier-ug
docker-compose logs -f tier-grad
```

## Testing the APIs

### Test High School Tier

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/tutor \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"student_id":"test_001","question":"How do I solve 2x+5=11?","subject":"algebra1"}'
```

### Test Undergraduate Tier

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/socratic \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"student_id":"test_001","question":"Explain limits","discipline":"calculus","require_citations":true}'
```

### Test Graduate Tier

```bash
curl http://localhost:8003/health
```

## What Needs to Be Done Next

### 1. Add API Keys (Required for AI Features)

Edit the `.env` file and add your API keys:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 2. Implement Frontend Applications (Optional)

The web applications in the `apps/` directory are placeholders. To enable them:

1. **Create Next.js Applications**
   - Implement the React/Next.js apps in:
     - `apps/web-hs/` (High School frontend)
     - `apps/web-ug/` (Undergraduate frontend)
     - `apps/web-grad/` (Graduate frontend)
     - `apps/admin/` (Admin dashboard)

2. **Create Dockerfiles**
   - Each app needs a `Dockerfile` for containerization
   - Example Dockerfile for Next.js apps:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

3. **Uncomment in docker-compose.yml**
   - Once apps are implemented, uncomment the web service sections

## Available Make Commands

```bash
make help           # Show all available commands
make docker-up      # Start all services
make docker-down    # Stop all services
make docker-clean   # Clean and reset Docker volumes
make test           # Run tests (when in local dev mode)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Find and kill processes using the ports
lsof -i :8001
lsof -i :5432
# Then kill with: kill -9 <PID>
```

### Services Not Starting

```bash
# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# Rebuild services
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Restart database
docker-compose restart postgres

# Check logs
docker-compose logs postgres
```

## Key Features

### High School Tier
- CCSS/NGSS/AP standards alignment
- Gamification (XP, badges, streaks)
- Multilingual support
- Safety filters and COPPA compliance
- Adaptive practice sets

### Undergraduate Tier
- Socratic tutoring with citations
- Lab template generation
- Code autograding (Python/JS)
- LTI 1.3 LMS integration
- Plagiarism detection

### Graduate Tier
- Literature review tools

- Statistical power analysis
- Thesis coaching with LaTeX export
- IRB assessment guidance

## Next Steps

1. **Start the services**: `make docker-up`
2. **Explore the APIs**: Visit http://localhost:8001/docs
3. **Add your API keys**: Edit the `.env` file
4. **Test the endpoints**: Use the curl commands above
5. **Build frontends** (optional): Implement the Next.js apps

## Resources

- **Full Documentation**: See [GETTING_STARTED.md](./GETTING_STARTED.md)
- **Project Overview**: See [START_HERE.md](./START_HERE.md)
- **API Documentation**: Available at `/docs` endpoint for each service

## Support

- Check service logs: `docker-compose logs -f [service-name]`
- Read the documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Review the README files in each service directory
