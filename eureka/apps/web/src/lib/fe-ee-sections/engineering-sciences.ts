      title: '1. Electrical Power and Energy',
      content: `## 1.1 Power Fundamentals

**$P = V\\cdot I$** (instantaneous power in watts)

For resistive elements, three equivalent forms:
- **$P = V\\cdot I = I^{2}R = V^{2}/R$**

All three give the same result; choose based on which quantities you know.

### Energy

Energy is power integrated over time: **$W = \\int P dt = P\\cdot t$** (for constant power)

Units: 1 joule = 1 watt·second; 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ

## 1.2 Energy Stored in Reactive Elements

| Element | Energy Formula | Stored In |
|---|---|---|
| Capacitor | **$W = \\tfrac{1}{2} CV^{2}$** | Electric field |
| Inductor | **$W = \\tfrac{1}{2} LI^{2}$** | Magnetic field |

Reactive elements store and return energy — they do NOT dissipate power (ideal case). Only resistors dissipate power as heat.

## 1.3 Efficiency

**η = P_out / P_in = (useful output) / (total input)**

- Always less than 100% due to losses
- Losses include: I²R (copper losses), core losses, friction, windage

| Device | Typical Efficiency |
|---|---|
| Power transformer | 95-99% |
| Electric motor | 80-95% |
| Solar panel | 15-22% |
| LED lighting | 30-50% |`,
      examTip: 'P = V·I = I²R = V²/R — know all three forms and choose wisely. If you know V and R, use V²/R (do not solve for I first). If you know I and R, use I²R. This saves calculation steps on the FE exam.',

      title: '2. Electromechanical Energy Conversion',
      content: `## 2.1 Mechanical Power

**$P_{mech} = \\tau \\cdot \\omega$** (torque × angular velocity)

Where τ is in N·m and ω is in rad/s.

### Conversion: Electrical ↔ Mechanical

- **Motor**: electrical input → mechanical output; P_elec = V·I, P_mech = τ·ω
- **Generator**: mechanical input → electrical output; P_mech = τ·ω, P_elec = V·I

Efficiency: η = P_out/P_in (losses = P_in - P_out)

## 2.2 Conservation of Energy

In any system: **Energy in = Energy out + Losses**

For a motor: V·I = τ·ω + P_copper + P_core + P_friction

This energy balance is fundamental to every power conversion problem on the FE exam.

## 2.3 Kinetic and Potential Energy

- **Kinetic**: KE = ½mv²
- **Gravitational potential**: PE = mgh
- **Spring potential**: PE = ½kx²

These appear in electromechanical problems where electrical energy converts to or from mechanical energy (motors, generators, actuators).`,
      examTip: 'For motor problems: input power = V·I (electrical), output power = τ·ω (mechanical), and η = τ·ω/(V·I). Always check units: ω must be in rad/s (not RPM). Convert: ω = 2π·(RPM)/60.',
      importantNote: 'Mechanical power P = τ·ω requires ω in rad/s. A common FE exam error is using RPM directly. Always convert: ω (rad/s) = 2π × N (rev/s) = 2π × RPM / 60.',

  keyTakeaways: [
    'P = V·I = I²R = V²/R; three equivalent forms for resistive power.',
    'Capacitor energy: W = ½CV²; inductor energy: W = ½LI².',
    'Efficiency η = P_out/P_in; always < 100% due to losses.',

      title: '1. Charge, Current, and Voltage',
      content: `## 1.1 Electric Charge

**Charge** Q is measured in coulombs (C). One electron carries q = 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ C.

## 1.2 Current

**$I = dQ/dt$** (rate of charge flow, in amperes)

- 1 ampere = 1 coulomb/second
- **Conventional current** flows from + to - (opposite to electron flow)
- DC is constant; AC varies sinusoidally

## 1.3 Voltage

**$V = dW/dQ$** (work per unit charge, in volts)

- 1 volt = 1 joule/coulomb
- Voltage is the "pressure" that drives current through resistance
- **Ohm's law**: V = I·R

## 1.4 Coulomb's Law

Force between point charges:

**$F = k\\cdot Q_{1}\\cdot Q_{2}/r^{2}$** where k = 8.99×$10^{9}$ N·m²/C²

- Like charges repel; opposite charges attract
- Force decreases with square of distance (inverse-square law)

### Electric Field

**$E = F/Q = V/d$** (for uniform field)

| Quantity | Symbol | Unit | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Charge | Q | Coulomb (C) | Fundamental quantity |
| Current | I | Ampere (A) | dQ/dt |
| Voltage | V | Volt (V) | dW/dQ |
| Electric field | E | V/m or N/C | Force per unit charge |`,
      examTip: 'I = dQ/dt and V = dW/dQ are the two most fundamental definitions. Ohm\'s law V = IR is an empirical relationship for resistive materials — it does NOT apply to capacitors, inductors, or nonlinear devices like diodes.',

      title: '2. Lorentz Force and Moving Charges',
      content: `## 2.1 The Lorentz Force

A charge q moving with velocity v in electric field E and magnetic field B experiences:

**$F = q(E + v \\times B)$**

- Electric force qE: along E direction (accelerates or decelerates charge)
- Magnetic force q(v×B): perpendicular to both v and B (deflects without doing work)

## 2.2 Force on a Current-Carrying Conductor

**$F = I\\cdot L \\times B = B\\cdot I\\cdot L\\cdot \\sin \\theta$**

Where L is the conductor length vector and θ is the angle between L and B.

Direction: use the **right-hand rule** — point fingers along I, curl toward B, thumb gives F direction.

## 2.3 Applications

- **DC motor**: current in magnetic field → force → rotation
- **Generator**: conductor moves through field → induced EMF
- **Hall effect sensor**: moving charges deflected → voltage across conductor
- **Mass spectrometer**: magnetic force separates ions by mass

### Motional EMF

A conductor moving through a magnetic field:

**$\\varepsilon = B\\cdot L\\cdot v$** (for v perpendicular to B and L)`,
      examTip: 'The Lorentz force F = q(E + v×B) combines electric and magnetic forces. The magnetic force is always PERPENDICULAR to velocity — it changes direction but not speed (does no work). This is why magnetic fields deflect charges but cannot accelerate them.',
    },
  ],
  keyTakeaways: [
    'Current I = dQ/dt; voltage V = dW/dQ; Ohm\'s law V = IR for resistive elements.',
    'Coulomb\'s law: F = k·Q₁·Q₂/r²; inverse-square law.',
    'Lorentz force: F = q(E + v×B); magnetic force is perpendicular to velocity.',
    'Force on conductor: F = BIL; direction by right-hand rule.',
    'Motional EMF: ε = BLv for conductor moving through field.',

      title: '1. Motors and Generators',
      content: `## 1.1 Motor Principles

A current-carrying loop in a magnetic field experiences torque:

**$\\tau = N\\cdot B\\cdot I\\cdot A\\cdot \\sin \\theta$**

Where N = turns, B = flux density, I = current, A = loop area, θ = angle to field.

- **Maximum torque**: τ_max = NBIA (when θ = 90°)
- **Motor equation**: V_applied = I·R + E_back
- **Back-EMF**: E_back = k·ω (proportional to speed)

### Motor Operation

At startup: ω = 0 → E_back = 0 → large inrush current I = V/R.
At steady state: E_back ≈ V → small current (just supplying load + losses).

## 1.2 Generator Principles

**Faraday's law**: ε = -N·dΦ/dt

A rotating coil in a magnetic field:

**$\\varepsilon = N\\cdot B\\cdot \\omega \\cdot A\\cdot \\cos (\\omega t)$**

- Peak EMF: ε_peak = NBAω
- Higher speed → higher voltage
- This is the basis of all AC generators

## 1.3 Power Conversion

| Device | Input | Output | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Motor | V·I (electrical) | τ·ω (mechanical) | $\\eta = \\tau \\cdot \\omega /(V\\cdot I)$ |
| Generator | τ·ω (mechanical) | V·I (electrical) | $\\eta = V\\cdot I/(\\tau \\cdot \\omega)$ |`,
      examTip: 'Motors and generators use the same electromagnetic principles in opposite directions. The motor equation V = IR + E_back is essential: at high speed, E_back is large so current is small. At stall (ω=0), current is maximum V/R — this is why motors need current limiting at startup.',

| Sensor | Measures | Principle | Key Formula |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strain gauge | Deformation | Resistance change | $\\Delta R/R = GF\\cdot \\varepsilon$ |
| Thermistor | Temperature | R(T) changes | $R = R_{0}\\cdot \\exp [\\beta (1/T-1/T_{0})]$ |
| Thermocouple | Temperature | Seebeck voltage | $V \\propto \\Delta T$ |
| Accelerometer | Acceleration | Piezoelectric/MEMS | V ∝ acceleration |
| Pressure sensor | Pressure | Diaphragm deflection | V ∝ pressure |

## 2.2 Sensor Characteristics

- **Sensitivity**: output change per unit input (e.g., mV/°C)
- **Accuracy**: closeness to true value
- **Precision**: repeatability of measurements
- **Linearity**: output proportional to input over range
- **Resolution**: smallest detectable change

## 2.3 Wheatstone Bridge

The **Wheatstone bridge** extracts small resistance changes from sensors:

At balance: **$R_{1}/R_{2} = R_{3}/R_{4}$** → output voltage = 0

When one arm changes by ΔR (sensor):
- Output voltage **$V_{out} \\approx V_{supply} \\cdot \\Delta R/(4R)$** (for small ΔR)

Used with strain gauges, RTDs, and other resistive sensors for precise measurement.`,
      examTip: 'For the strain gauge formula ΔR/R = GF·ε, the gauge factor GF ≈ 2 for metallic gauges. The Wheatstone bridge detects the tiny ΔR by producing a proportional output voltage. This is the standard measurement circuit for resistive sensors.',
    },
  ],
  keyTakeaways: [
    'Motor torque: τ = NBIA·sinθ; maximum when loop perpendicular to field.',
    'Back-EMF: E_back = kω; motor equation: V = IR + E_back.',
    'Generator EMF: ε = NBAω·cos(ωt); higher speed = higher voltage.',
    'Strain gauge: ΔR/R = GF·ε (GF ≈ 2); thermistor: exponential R(T).',
    'Wheatstone bridge: balance condition R₁/R₂ = R₃/R₄; detects small ΔR.',
