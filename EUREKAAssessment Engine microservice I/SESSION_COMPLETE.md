## 🎨 HOW TO INTEGRATE WITH YOUR EXISTING PROJECT

### Option 1: Copy to Eureka Project

```bash
# Copy the Assessment Engine to your project
cp -r eduflow-services/services/assess /path/to/eureka/services/

# Update your main docker-compose.yml
# Add the assess service configuration
```

### Option 2: Use as Reference

```bash
# Use it as a template for other services
# - Same structure
# - Same patterns
# - Same conventions
```

### Option 3: Standalone Microservice

```bash
# Run it independently on port 8002
# Let your API Core proxy to it
```
