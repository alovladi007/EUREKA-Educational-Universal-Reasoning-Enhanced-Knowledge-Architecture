# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the EUREKA community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on advancing education for all.

## Our Standards

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community and learners
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with newcomers and those learning
* Assuming good intentions and seeking clarification before taking offense
* Celebrating and respecting diversity in backgrounds, expertise, and perspectives

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind

* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continuing to initiate interaction with someone after being asked to stop
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional and educational setting

## Educational Context

Given EUREKA's mission to serve learners from high school through professional education, we hold ourselves to additional standards:

### Protecting Learners

* **Student Privacy**: Never share or discuss specific student data, performance, or personally identifiable information in public forums
* **Age-Appropriate**: Be mindful that some community members may be minors; maintain professional boundaries
* **Educational Purpose**: Keep discussions focused on improving learning outcomes and educational equity
* **Accessibility First**: Ensure all communications and contributions are accessible to people with disabilities

### Academic Integrity

* Give proper attribution for ideas, code, and content
* Do not promote or assist in academic dishonesty
* Respect intellectual property rights
* Be transparent about conflicts of interest

### Professional Conduct

* Maintain the same professional standards you would in an educational institution
* Respect the diverse roles in education (students, educators, administrators, researchers)
* Acknowledge expertise while remaining open to learning from all community members
* Keep partisan politics out of technical discussions

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

* Using an official e-mail address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Contributing to EUREKA repositories
* Participating in EUREKA discussions, forums, or communication channels

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**conduct@eureka.edu**

For urgent safety concerns, contact: **urgent@eureka.edu**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Confidentiality

We will keep reporters' identities confidential unless:
* The reporter explicitly consents to disclosure
* There is an imminent safety risk
* We are legally required to disclose

### What to Include in a Report

* Your contact information (for follow-up)
* Names/usernames of people involved
* Description of the behavior
* When and where it occurred
* Any witnesses or additional context
* Whether the situation is ongoing
* Any previous incidents involving the same person
* Screenshots or logs (if available and relevant)

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals

If you believe you have been unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you may appeal the decision by contacting **appeals@eureka.edu** within 14 days of notification. Appeals should include:

* The original complaint details (if available to you)
* Why you believe the decision was incorrect
* Any additional context or evidence

Appeals will be reviewed by a different group of community leaders than those who made the original decision.

## Acknowledgments and Clarifications

### Special Considerations for Educational Context

**Working with Minors**: Some EUREKA contributors and users may be minors (under 18). All interactions with minors must:
* Be appropriate for an educational setting
* Maintain professional boundaries
* Comply with child protection laws
* Occur in public community spaces (not private DMs)
* Be transparent and observable by guardians/educators

**Data Privacy**: Given the sensitive nature of educational data:
* Never share student data without proper authorization
* Follow FERPA, COPPA, and GDPR requirements
* Report any potential data breaches immediately
* Do not use production data for testing or demonstrations

**Accessibility**: We are committed to accessibility:
* Provide alt text for images
* Use clear, simple language
* Format code samples for screen readers
* Respect various learning and communication styles

### Interaction with Educational Institutions

When interacting with schools, universities, and other educational institutions:
* Respect institutional policies and hierarchies
* Maintain confidentiality of institutional information
* Follow procurement and partnership processes
* Be transparent about commercial interests
