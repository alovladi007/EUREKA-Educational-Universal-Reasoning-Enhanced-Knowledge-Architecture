## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Where to Report

Send vulnerability reports to: **security@eureka.edu**

Include the following information:
- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability

### Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed response with remediation plan
- **30 days**: Target for patch release (varies by severity)

### Bug Bounty

We currently do not offer a bug bounty program, but we deeply appreciate responsible disclosure and will publicly acknowledge reporters (unless anonymity is requested).

## Security Measures

### Data Protection

**Encryption:**
- Data at rest: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- Data in transit: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- Database: Encrypted connections with SSL/TLS
- Object storage: Server-side encryption enabled

**Access Control:**
- Multi-tenant architecture with org-scoped isolation
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with least privilege
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions
- OAuth 2.0 / OIDC for authentication
- SAML 2.0 for institutional SSO

### Compliance Frameworks

#### FERPA (All Tiers)
- Audit logs for all student record access
- Consent tracking for data sharing
- Data retention policies (7 years default)
- Right to access and amend records
- Annual security training for staff

#### HIPAA (Medical Tier)
- PHI de-identification before AI processing
- Business Associate Agreements (BAA) with vendors
- Breach notification procedures
- 6-year audit log retention
- Encrypted backups with key rotation

#### COPPA (High School Tier)
- Parental consent for users under 13
- Age verification mechanisms
- Restricted data collection for minors
- No targeted advertising to children
- Annual privacy policy review with parents

#### ABA (Law Tier)
- Client confidentiality protections
- Conflict-checking mechanisms
- Attorney-client privilege safeguards
- Ethics training module tracking

### Application Security

**Code Security:**
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with Bandit
- Dependency scanning with Snyk/Dependabot
- Container scanning with Trivy
- Regular security audits

**Runtime Security:**
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS protection
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS protection (CSP headers)

**API Security:**
- API key rotation every 90 days
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- Refresh token rotation
- Request signing for sensitive operations

### Infrastructure Security

**Cloud Security:**
- Private VPCs with security groups
- Database encryption at rest
- Secrets management with HashiCorp Vault
- Regular security group audits
- Principle of least privilege for IAM

**Monitoring:**
- 24/7 security monitoring
- Intrusion detection systems (IDS)
- Anomaly detection for data access
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Automated alerts for suspicious activity

### AI Safety & Privacy

**LLM Security:**
- Prompt injection protection
- PII detection and redaction in prompts
- No storage of student data in external LLM provider logs
- Local model options for sensitive tiers
- Output guardrails and content filtering

**Data Minimization:**
- Collect only necessary data
- Aggregate and anonymize where possible
- Regular data purging based on retention policies
- User-initiated data deletion

## Incident Response

### Response Plan

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring + user reports
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
4. **Eradication**: Remove vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems securely
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-mortem and prevention updates

### Breach Notification

In the event of a data breach:
- Affected users notified within 72 hours
- Regulatory authorities notified per compliance requirements
- Public disclosure if severity warrants
- Remediation steps provided to affected parties

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### For Developers

**DO:**
- ✅ Use parameterized queries (never string concatenation)
- ✅ Validate and sanitize all inputs
- ✅ Use environment variables for secrets
- ✅ Implement proper error handling (no sensitive data in errors)
- ✅ Follow principle of least privilege
- ✅ Write security tests
- ✅ Keep dependencies up to date
- ✅ Use CSP headers
- ✅ Implement rate limiting

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Commit secrets or API keys
- ❌ Log sensitive data (PII, PHI, passwords)
- ❌ Trust user input
- ❌ Use outdated or deprecated libraries
- ❌ Disable security features in production
- ❌ Use weak cryptographic algorithms
- ❌ Hardcode credentials

### For Institutions

**Deployment Security:**
- Change all default passwords
- Enable 2FA for admin accounts
- Configure WAF rules
- Set up backup encryption
- Enable audit logging
- Regular security reviews
- Incident response drills

**Operational Security:**
- Background checks for personnel with data access
- Regular security training
- Least privilege access policies
- Vendor security assessments
- Regular penetration testing

## Security Audits

**Internal Audits:**
- Quarterly code reviews
- Monthly dependency scans
- Weekly vulnerability assessments

**External Audits:**
- Annual third-party security audit
- Annual penetration testing
- SOC 2 Type II audit (target for production)

## Secure Development Lifecycle

1. **Requirements**: Security requirements defined
2. **Design**: Threat modeling conducted
3. **Implementation**: Secure coding guidelines followed
4. **Testing**: Security tests mandatory
5. **Deployment**: Security checklist required
6. **Operations**: Continuous monitoring
7. **Maintenance**: Regular patching schedule
